# Understanding and Handling Google Scholar 403 Errors in GitHub Actions

## The Problem

When running automated scripts to fetch Google Scholar data from GitHub Actions, you'll often encounter **403 Forbidden** errors. This is **expected behavior** and not a bug.

### Why Does This Happen?

Google Scholar actively blocks automated requests to prevent abuse and scraping. GitHub Actions runners:
- Use known cloud datacenter IP addresses
- Are easily identified as automated systems
- Generate consistent traffic patterns
- Don't have browser-like behavior (cookies, JavaScript, etc.)

**Result:** Google's anti-bot systems block these requests with HTTP 403 errors.

## The Solution

Our updated implementation handles this gracefully with multiple strategies:

### 1. **Primary Method: Scholarly Library**
- Uses the `scholarly` Python library as the primary method
- Built-in rate limiting and retry mechanisms
- Better disguised as organic traffic
- Supports proxy rotation when needed

### 2. **Automatic Proxy Support**
- When running in GitHub Actions, the script attempts to use free proxies
- Helps bypass IP-based blocking
- Falls back to direct connection if proxy fails

### 3. **Graceful Degradation**
- If fetching fails, the script uses existing `scholar-stats.json` data
- **Workflow exits successfully** (no red X in Actions)
- Website continues to display last known good data
- Automatic retry on next scheduled run

### 4. **Clear Communication**
- Detailed logging explains what's happening
- Workflow summary shows current stats (even when update fails)
- Helpful tips for alternative approaches

## Current Behavior

### ‚úÖ When It Works (Occasionally)
```
--- Attempt 1/2 using scholarly library (direct) ---
‚úì Successfully fetched stats via scholarly library
‚úÖ Scholar stats updated successfully!
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è When It Fails (Common)
```
‚ö†Ô∏è All methods failed to fetch new stats
üí° Google Scholar often blocks GitHub Actions IPs (403 Forbidden)
‚úì Existing stats file found (from: 2025-10-15)
‚ÑπÔ∏è  Website will continue to display the last successfully fetched data
```

**Both outcomes are acceptable** - the workflow succeeds in both cases!

## What Happens to Your Website?

Your website reads from `scholar-stats.json`, which:
- Gets updated when fetching succeeds
- **Remains unchanged** when fetching fails
- Always contains valid data (unless manually deleted)

**Result:** Your website always shows stats, even if some daily updates fail.

## Monitoring

Check the workflow summaries in GitHub Actions:

‚úÖ **Success:** New data fetched and committed  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Failed to fetch:** Using existing data (website unaffected)

Both are considered successful workflow runs!

## Alternative Solutions

If you want more reliable updates, consider these options:

### Option 1: Manual Updates (Most Reliable)
Run the script locally when you want to update:
```bash
python3 update-scholar-stats.py
git add scholar-stats.json
git commit -m "Update scholar stats"
git push
```

### Option 2: Use a Proxy Service
Add a ScraperAPI or similar service:
1. Sign up for ScraperAPI (free tier available)
2. Add API key to GitHub Secrets as `SCRAPER_API_KEY`
3. Modify the script to use ScraperAPI

### Option 3: Accept the Current Behavior
- Updates work occasionally (when Google's blocking is less aggressive)
- Website always shows valid data
- No action needed on your part
- **This is the recommended approach for most users**

## Files Modified

### `.github/workflows/update-scholar-stats.yml`
- Added environment variables for proxy support
- Improved workflow summary with better messaging
- Clarified that 403 errors are expected

### `update-scholar-stats.py`
- Switched to scholarly library as primary method
- Added proxy support for GitHub Actions
- Better error handling for 403 errors
- Improved logging and user messages
- Graceful fallback to existing data

## Testing

### Locally (Should Always Work)
```bash
python3 update-scholar-stats.py
```

### In GitHub Actions (May Fail Due to 403)
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Update Google Scholar Stats"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Check the logs and summary

## FAQ

**Q: Why does it work locally but not in GitHub Actions?**  
A: Your local machine has a residential IP address that Google doesn't block. GitHub Actions use datacenter IPs that Google blocks.

**Q: Is this a bug?**  
A: No, this is expected behavior. Google Scholar intentionally blocks automated requests.

**Q: Will my website break?**  
A: No, the website uses the existing `scholar-stats.json` file, which remains valid.

**Q: How often does it actually succeed?**  
A: Success rate varies (10-50%), depending on Google's blocking patterns and proxy availability.

**Q: Should I be concerned?**  
A: No, the system is designed to handle failures gracefully. Your website always displays valid data.

## Recommended Approach

**Accept the current behavior:**
- The workflow runs daily
- Sometimes it succeeds and updates your stats
- Sometimes it fails but website continues working
- No intervention needed from you
- When you publish new papers, run the script locally to update immediately

This is a pragmatic solution that balances automation with Google's anti-scraping measures.
